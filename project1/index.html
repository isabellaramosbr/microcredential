      <h1 class="title">Belo Horizonte</h1>
      <p>The capital of the state of Minas Gerais since 1897, Belo Horizonte was only a few years earlier carved out of the forest surrounding a gold-diggers' settlement called Curral del Rei, which was founded in 1701.</p>
      <p>Because it was an entirely new city, it could be laid out on a grid plan with intersecting diagonal avenues modeled on Washington, D.C. Its name, meaning beautiful horizon, is apt, both for the mountains that ring the city and for its own Modernist and Postmodern skyline.</p>
      <p>The city was built at the height of the Art Nouveau and Art Deco styles and has continued to embrace contemporary architecture ever since. Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer designed several of his first buildings here in the 1940s, giving the city some of his best-known works and top tourist attractions. Later buildings have continued to match his high design standards.</p>
      <p>You can find the best places to visit by following this list of the top tourist attractions in Belo Horizonte.</p>

      <h3 class="section-subtitle" id="freedomsquare"><a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pra%C3%A7a_da_Liberdade_(Belo_Horizonte)" target="_blank">Praça da Liberdade (Freedom Square)</a></h3>

      </figure>
      <p>The large park-filled plaza in the city center was designed to be the hub of state administration and power, with the Palácio do Governo (Government Building) and the public library. The Art Deco style Palácio Cristo Rio was built in the 1940s, and towering above the square is Edificio Niemeyer, a sinuously curved apartment building that is one of his most famous early works.</p>
      <p>Strolling under the shade trees or relaxing on a bench to enjoy the flowers and fountains are the locals' favorite things to do here, and they make Praça da Liberdade one of the most popular places to go in Belo Horizonte.</p>

          <img src="images/pampulha.jpeg" alt="View of Sao Francisco de Assis Church" class="img-fluid"></a>
      </figure>
      <p>The first of architect Oscar Niemeyer's major works stands above a lake in the park-filled suburb of Pampulha. The parabolic curves of the church's roof seem to anticipate architectural forms Neimeyer later used in Brasília.</p>
      <p>The exterior is covered in azulejo tile panels by Cândido Portinari, and more of his work decorates the interior. The building's design caused such a furor in the church hierarchy that, although it was completed several decades earlier, it was not consecrated until 1969. The surrounding gardens were designed by landscape architect Roberto Burle Marx.</p>
      <p> Walk around the lake to admire the church's silhouette mirrored in the water and to see the curved Casa do Baile, scene of fashionable parties and dances in the 1940s. Green lawns and paths around Lagoa da Pampulha make it a favorite place to visit for families.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>One of the liveliest and most colorful places in the city is the huge market building, where you'll find everything from food to canaries in its 400-odd stalls. Vendors appear to be in perpetual motion as they hawk fruits and vegetables, cheese, sausages, religious items, herbal medicines, candy, drinks, meats, flowers, nuts, household utensils, prepared foods, pets, and handicrafts.</p>
      <p>Stop to watch as the fruit sellers peel and slice whole pineapples with a machete, and wait your turn for a seat in one of the tiny lunch stands to sample local dishes. The market is open daily, although only until 1 pm on Sundays and holidays.</p>
